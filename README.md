God is the eternal, all-powerful, all-knowing, and ever-present Creator of everything that exists. From the beginning of time, He designed the universe with wisdom and purpose. He created the earth with beauty and order—separating light from darkness, forming the sky, land, and seas, and filling the world with plants, animals, and life of all kinds. Everything He made was good. Then, God created human beings in His own image, giving us the unique ability to think, love, create, and have a relationship with Him. He gave us the earth to care for, to live in, and to enjoy. But even though He gave us everything, humanity disobeyed Him, bringing sin, suffering, and separation into the world. Yet God, full of mercy and love, didn’t give up on us. Instead, He made a way to bring us back to Him. He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to live among us—to teach us truth, show us love, and take the punishment for our sins by dying on the cross. Through Jesus, we are offered forgiveness, hope, and eternal life. God didn’t just save our souls—He cares about the earth too. He calls us to be good stewards of creation, to care for the planet and for each other. Every day, He provides for us—through nature, through people, and through His Spirit. God continues to be present, guiding, protecting, and inviting everyone into a life of peace, love, and purpose with Him. In everything, He shows us that He is a good and faithful God who deeply loves both the world He made and the people in it.# All-About-him.
